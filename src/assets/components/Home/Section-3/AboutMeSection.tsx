    <p className="text-silver text-justify max-w-2xl m-auto leading-normal text-lg">Hey! My name is Francisco Luna. I'm a 18 years old Front End Developer from Venezuela. Here I'll be telling my story with web development </p> <br/>
    <p className="text-silver text-justify max-w-2xl m-auto leading-normal text-lg">I started my coding Joruney when I was 16. I always loved to create stuff so I started learning Python in mid 2021. I grasped the fundamentals of coding in the previous language and created a few simple projects. It wasn't until the beggining of 2022 when I started learning JavaScript and therefore CSS and HTML. I created some simple projects with vanilla technologies to reinforce my knowledge. Once I felt confident with the fundamentals of web development, I started to experiment with new frameworks and tools such as ReactJS, Vite, MongoDB, TailwindCSS, TypeScript and so on. </p> <br/>
    <p className="text-silver text-justify max-w-2xl m-auto leading-normal text-lg">My main goal right now is to start working with new people and companies to deepen my knowledge within both Front End and Back End development using mainly the MERN (MongoDB, Express.JS, ReactJS and NodeJS) stack as well as sharpening technical concepts such as clean architecture, code, more kinds of testing and expanding my capability for working with teams and collaborating with them.</p>
    <h3 className=" font-bold text-silver text-xl">How do I work?</h3>
